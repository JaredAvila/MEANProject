We can communicate here if needed.

Ok, it appears that the node modules did NOT get pushed. So yeah, NPM install. See you Mon. -Jared

(Justin) Added gitignore file used in the MAEN deployment section.
(Justin) If I'm not mistaken, github prevents "node_modules" from being pushed because they're so big.

(Justin) @Jared, for the front-end, it would be nice have the raw "html and css" pushed here as well once done. So we all can work on the components together.

(Jared)  I was gonna try and get a simple clickable done using angular routing by torrow. I'll get some more done tonight as well.  Only got the mobile view of the root-component done so far, and it's only about 75% done. Had to figure out how to make jQuery work with Angular.

(Justin) Mohammed mentioned that jQuery does not work well with angular and that angular does not want jQuery to be used with it. However, I once saw a video on youtube saying that most of the things you can do with jQuery, you can also do in Vanilla JavaScript. I guess it's just a matter of tranlating from jQuery to VanillaJS. But I haven't had much experience with it. hehehe.
(Justin) Also, I'm making a trello page for our project to help us manage our tasks and track our progress. I'll send you guys an invite once it's done.

(Jared) jQuery seems to be working just fine. It's bootstrap that I am having issues with. I can't get the carousel to work... might have to scrap it or build it myself if we have time. Gonna use a static image for now so I can move on with the layout of the whole page and come back to it later

(Kirk) I noticed that everytime we add to the readme.txt file, it is commited and loggged. Is it much better to have our conversation on a different platform so that the commits made are exclusively for the files we are working on? For traceability purposes. I can set-up a group message in mattermost if your good with it? Please confirm. Thanks.
