We can communicate here if needed.

Ok, it appears that the node modules did NOT get pushed. So yeah, NPM install. See you Mon. -Jared

(Justin) Added gitignore file used in the MAEN deployment section.
(Justin) If I'm not mistaken, github prevents "node_modules" from being pushed because they're so big.

(Justin) @Jared, for the front-end, it would be nice have the raw "html and css" pushed here as well once done. So we all can work on the components together.

(Jared)  I was gonna try and get a simple clickable done using angular routing by torrow. I'll get some more done tonight as well.  Only got the mobile view of the root-component done so far, and it's only about 75% done. Had to figure out how to make jQuery work with Angular.
